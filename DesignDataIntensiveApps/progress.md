# Designing Data Intensive Applications

## Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, Maintainable

- thinking about data systems
    * create data systems with application code that strings together multiple smaller pieces
    * combine them under one API that hides complexity (abstraction)
    * many factors influence system design

- This book will focus on 3 concerns that applies for most software systems
    * Reliability: correct function; even with software/hardware faults and human errors
    * Scalability: reasonable ways to deal with growth
    * Maintainability: many people should be able to work productively on the system
